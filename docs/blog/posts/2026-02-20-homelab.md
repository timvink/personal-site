# Homelab

Hopefully you're feeling excited by all the possibilities by now. However with self-hosting comes new responsibilities: not losing data, and security. 

<!-- more -->

## Setup 3-2-1 backups

If you're going to store important data like your financial administration or personal photo history on a home server, you need to be sure you don't lose it. The *3-2-1 backup rule* is a, tried-and-tested, reliable data protection strategy requiring 3 total copies of data, stored on 2 different media types, with 1 copy located off-site. In practice this means your server should have RAID storage; a *redundant array of inexpensive disks*. Basically this means your computer sees a single disk, but data is written to more than one disk. RAID has several different modes. For example RAID 1 mirrors two drives, while RAID 5 works across at least 3 drivers. With RAID, when a drive fails, you simply replace it with a new one. European cloud providers like OVHcloud, Scaleway or Hetzner offer off-site 'cold storage' for 2-3 euros per TB per month, so you can always have a backup of your RAID storage.

Setting up RAID storage with off-site backups is made very easy with the right software. In the screenshot below you can see that it's a few clicks in a UI when you use [zimaOS](https://www.zimaspace.com/zimaos). When you attach RAID storage to your home server computer, the setup is often called a *NAS*; Network Attached Storage. ZimaOS is a 'NAS OS', meant to run on your home server to help you manage all the software you want to run on it.

There is one last thing to worry about: *bit rot*. This silent corruption is the slow unintentional decay of stored digital data over time, where individual bits (0s and 1s) flip to their opposite state. This phenomenon affects both HDDs and SSDs, leading to unreadable files or corrupted data. The solution to use the ZFS filesystem on your RAID storage. It calculates and stores a unique checksum hash of each file. When you open a file, ZFS will calculate the checksum again, and if it has changed (due to bit rot) it will 'auto-heal' by using the backup file. But if you don't open a photo for 10 years, there is still a chance *both* backups have been corrupted. That's why you should schedule a weekly 'scrub' your NAS, that will check and repair all files on your RAID.

## Choosing your hardware and software

There is so much NAS hardware and software out there, that it can be a bit overwhelming. To help you out: you'll want at least 16 Gb of RAM and multiple storage slots for your RAID setup. If you're planning to stream 4K content, choose an Intel CPU, because they have a hardware technology called Quicksync for *incredibly* fast, efficient video encoding/decoding. Some good options as of Feb 2026:

- The [Beelink N150](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150) ($469). Has 6 all SSD slots of very fast NVMe storage
- The [Asustor FLASHSTOR 6 FS6706T](https://www.coolblue.nl/product/934863/asustor-flashstor-6-fs6706t.html) (€497) also has 6 SSD slots.
- The [Minisforum N5 Air](https://minisforumpc.eu/products/n5-air-ai-nas?variant=53191150240110) (€719) has 5 HDD bays and 3 SSD bays.

You'll need to buy the storage also, which has become twice as expensive due to high demand. I went for two [Lexar NM790 2TB](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1932944/lexar-nm790-zonder-heatsink-2tb.html) drives, which cost €205 each. Remember that you'll lose storage capacity to the RAID redundancy. You can always add more storage to your RAID setup later.

There are many good software options to choose from. On one end of the spectrum, you could just install linux and manage all the software yourself. That used to be reserved for the really dedicated system admins, but AI tools are making self-hosting easy and fun (see [2026 is the Year of Self-hosting](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)). On the other end of the spectrum is an integrated ecosystem approach like [umbrel](https://umbrel.com/), where all apps are a single click away, and updates are managed in the background. I went for the middleground, using the free open source [ZimaOS](https://www.zimaspace.com/zimaos) which manages a lot of complexity for you while still giving you the freedom to run your own code.

## Security and a quick intro to networking

Self-hosting means you don't risk data mining or account lockout (bot-driven bans happen). There is the risk of physical threft, which is especially dangerous when your are self-hosting your password manager. The solution is to always use 2-factor authentication (tip: [Proton Auth](https://proton.me/authenticator) with a secure backup of your recovery codes). You can also choose to encrypt your ZFS RAID storage disks by creating the setup through the command line.

You'll want to be able to securely access and share some services online while travelling or on the go. This is where you'll need some networking knowledge. A quick primer:

**VPN Mesh Networks**. You can setup a direct P2P (Peer to Peer) encrypted tunnel connection between a device and a service on your homelab. For example, the ZimaOS mobile app can connect to your homelab by scanning a QR to setup a secure P2P connection. Instead of doing this for a single application, there are 'Mesh VPN' cloud services that allow you to connect remotely to your entire home network. These services don't process any data, but act as a 'matchmaker' to introduce two devices, that then create a direct, encrypted tunnel between themselves. These kinds of zero-trust identity based connectivity platforms allow extreme security even while your device is connected to a public insecure wifi network. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a very well known Canadian company that has a free service you can use to setup these secure VPN Mesh network. A great European alternative is [Netbird](https://netbird.io/) which is free and open-source. The downside of this approach is that you will need to install a client on each device you want to connect, and login there. VPN Mesh networks won't work if you want to publicly host a service, or if you want to use a device where you can't install a client (f.e. connecting to your media server at home on the smart TV of your parents).

**Network Tunnels**. If you want to host a public server, like a website or a photo album (perhaps with hidden url), you can use a *network tunnel*. Normally you would open a port (*'Port Forwarding'*) in your router. But this means you are effectively poking a permanent hole in your router's firewall. Anyone on the internet can see and "knock" on that door. If the app behind that door has a security flaw, a hacker can walk right into your home network. Network tunnels like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) solve this by flipping the direction of the connection. Instead of waiting for the world to come to you, your server reaches out to Cloudflare, which acts as a "Bouncer". Your home server IP-adres won't be visible on the internet. You can even force a user to log in with Google/GitHub/Cloudflare before they even get a single packet of data to your server. The downside of this approach is that it requires a middleman. This means they can see the data, their server might be a constraint for latency, and often you'll be limited in the traffic throughput. Streaming 4K movies through a network tunnel is slower and often not allowed.

**Reverse Proxy**. You also have the option of setting up a reverse proxy. You open Port 443 on your router and point it to a "Security Guard" app like Nginx/caddy. This is very secure, as long you use very strong passwords.

**VPN**. Finally, the
