# Reproducible Reports with MkDocs

In the post [Using MkDocs for technical reporting](https://timvink.nl/mkdocs-for-tech-doc/) I explained how MkDocs works and why it's a good choice for writing technical reports.

In this post I'll explain how to work with different MkDocs plugins to make your documentation more reproducible. I find the topic exciting as the combination of these plugins is especially powerful. That's also why I wrote multiple MkDocs plugins and contributed to many more to make the workflow even smoother.

We'll use the example of documenting a machine learning model because the building process is quite iterative. Because models evolve and update frequently up to date model documentation that can keep up is essential.

## What artifacts should be reproducible

A model development proces might generate the following artifacts:

- Images: Binary images files, like `.png` files created by a plotting library.
- Variables: A list of one or more variables in `.yaml` files, such as for example training periods.
- Tables: Data structured in tabular manner, like `.csv` files
- Chart data: Data and chart specifications in `.json` files
- Standalone pages: `.HTML` files generated by tools like [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
- Notebooks: Relevant `.ipynb` files with deep-dives that combine code + text + output

We want to combine all of these artifacts into a coherent MkDocs documentation site.

Schematically:

## Generating artifacts on build

Obviously you'll first need to write the python code that (re)generates all the artifacts you want to include in your model documentation.
Here's a common project structure, where `scripts/` contains python code to generate artifacts that output to `docs/assets/`.

```
.                                
├── docs/                        # Project documentation
|   |── assets/                  # Stores generated artifacts
|   └── index.md
├── notebooks/                   # Project related Jupyter notebooks
├── src/                         # Project source code
├── scripts/                     # Stores scripts to generate artifacts
└── mkdocs.yml                   # MkDocs configuration
```

You could trigger building artifacts manually, by building a CLI (see [click](https://github.com/pallets/click), [typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) or [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)) or by using a [makefile](https://calmcode.io/makefiles/the-problem.html). But you could also trigger building artifacts on `mkdocs build` (or `mkdocs serve`) by using the mkdocs plugin [mkdocs-simple-hooks](https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks). For example, if you have a function `generate()` in `scripts/artifacts.py`:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - mkdocs-simple-hooks:
      hooks:
        on_pre_build: "scripts.artifacts:generate"
```

Because building artifacts can take quite some time for larger ML models, you can optionally disable the plugin while writing documentation by using environment variables:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - mkdocs-simple-hooks:
      enabled: !ENV [ENABLE_MKDOCS_SIMPLE_HOOKS, True]
      hooks:
        on_pre_build: "scripts.artifacts:generate"
```

```bash
export ENABLE_MKDOCS_SIMPLE_HOOKS=false
mkdocs serve
```

## Including tables

Probably one of the most common artifacts are tables. I wrote [mkdocs-table-reader-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-table-reader-plugin) to make it easy:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - table-reader:
      data_path: "docs/assets/tables"
```

And then in any markdown file you can insert a table using `{% raw %}{{ read_csv("tablename.csv") }}{% endraw %}`.

## Including variables

Another very common artifacts are variables; basically singular named values. [mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin](https://github.com/rosscdh/mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin) is an excellent plugin to help you get the job done:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - markdownextradata:
      data: docs/assets/variables
```

Add a file in `docs/assets/variables` like:

```yaml
# data.yml
auc_train: 0.76
auc_test: 0.74
```

And now you can insert variables in any markdown file using the syntax `{% raw %}{{ data.auc_train }}{% endraw %}`.

## Including charts

A variant on a table is a chart. Basically this is tabular data with some specification on how to visualize it. [vegalite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is an excellent solution, and I wrote [mkdocs-charts-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-charts-plugin) to bring support to MkDocs.

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - charts

extra_javascript:
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6

markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      custom_fences:
        - name: vegalite
          class: vegalite
          format: !!python/name:mkdocs_charts_plugin.fences.fence_vegalite
```

Now you can insert chart specifications anywhere in a markdown file, and have it rendered as a chart.

````
```vegalite 
{
  "description": "A simple bar chart with embedded data.",
  "data": {"url" : "assets/charts/data/basic_bar_chart.json"},
  "mark": {"type": "bar", "tooltip": true},
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "a", "type": "nominal", "axis": {"labelAngle": 0}},
    "y": {"field": "b", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```
````

Note that the data is located in `assets/charts/data/basic_bar_chart.json`, which means you can update it separately.

## Including notebooks

Especially when building machine learning models, there might be separate, fairly self-contained deep dives in notebooks you would like to include in your documentation. For example an experiment with different target definitions, or a review of fairness aspects. A notebook already contains code, text and output (tables and images).

The [mknotebooks](https://github.com/greenape/mknotebooks) plugin allows you to insert entire jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) directly into your MkDocs site. For example:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
nav:
  - your_notebook.ipynb

plugins:
  - mknotebooks
```

It's not well documented, but you can optionally remove input cells (the code) from the notebooks. See [this example](https://github.com/greenape/mknotebooks/tree/master/examples/cell_tag_remove).

## Including HTML

There are some great machine learning tools out there that can generate stand-alone HTML reports. For example [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) for exploratory data analysis, or [great expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) for data profiling.

You can export those files to `docs/assets/html` and simply link to them from your MkDocs navigation:
```
# mkdocs.yml
nav:
  - index.md
  - Some page: assets/html/page.html
```

If it's a small snippet of HTML, you can also use the [snippets markdown extension](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/) to embed external files, see the [example the mkdocs-material docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions/#snippets).


## Wrapping up

If you need even more flexibility in inserting content, you can use the [mkdocs_macros_plugin](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin) to define python functions. Using our machine learning example, you could write a python function `get_model_auc()` that queries [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and returns a score. You can then use it anywhere in your markdown files using `{% raw %}{{ get_model_auc() }}{% endraw %}`.

You might also want to use [mkdocs-git-authors-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-authors-plugin) to automatically add authors of each page by using information from git commits, or [mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin) to add the last edited date to each page.

With a now fully reproducible MkDocs website, you can use [mkdocs-print-site-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-print-site-plugin/tree/master/mkdocs_print_site_plugin) export to a PDF or a standalone HTML file (that you can share over HTML).
