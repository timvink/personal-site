# Starting my blog

I decided to add a blog to my personal website. I'll occasionally share some data science related posts. 

<!-- more -->

Main languages will be Python:

```python
def say_hello(person): return f'hello {person}!'
say_hello('world')
# > hello world!
```

And R:

```r
say_hello <- function(person) glue::glue("hello {person}!")
say_hello('world')
# > hello world!
```
