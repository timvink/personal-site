I'm a data literate digital native. I write code and use libraries with weird names. I think about applying new technologies to real world problems. I dream about a future where technology will help create an abundant future for mankind. I believe technology is changing the world for the better. My goal in life is to be part of the change and help shape our future.

Currently, I manage a data science team at <del><a href="https://www.ing.com">ING Bank</a></del> <a href="https://www.allianzdirect.nl/">Allianz Direct</a>.

I also do a lot of open source stuff -- check out my <a href="https://timvink.github.io/project-monitor/">overview of open source projects</a>
